Subject: Request for Data Analysis to Improve Marketing Strategy 

Hi Data Analyst,  

I hope this email finds you well. I’m the Marketing Manager at ShopEasy. We’ve been facing some challenges with our marketing campaigns lately, and I’m reaching out to request your expertise in data analysis to help us identify areas for improvement.  

Despite our increased investment in marketing, we’ve observed a decline in customer engagement and conversion rates. Our marketing expenses have gone up, but the return on investment isn’t meeting our expectations. We need a comprehensive analysis to understand the effectiveness of our current strategies and to find opportunities to optimize our efforts.

We have data from various sources, including customer reviews, social media comments, and campaign performance metrics. Your insights will be invaluable in helping us turn this situation around.  

Looking forward to your response.  

Best regards,  
Jane Doe  
Marketing Manager
